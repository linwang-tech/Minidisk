A calculation of field (near-saturated) hydraulic conductivity based on Mini Disk Infiltrometers's observation data was done. 

This repository contains:

- [Infiltration_example.xlsx](./Infiltration_example.xlsx): the example data of Mini Disk Infiltrometers's observation data
- [K.xlsx](./K.xlsx): the field (near-saturated) hydraulic conductivity result
- [K.Python](./K_example.ipynb): the Python script of field (near-saturated) hydraulic conductivity calculation
